### StockBot ðŸ“ˆ

A LangChain and LLM-based agent designed to assist with stock investment by utilizing real-time and historical financial data. As a retail investor without a finance background, understanding complex financial terms can be challenging and time-consuming. To address this issue, we have developed an AI bot that leverages LLM technology to provide investment analysis.

### Data sources

The agent incorporates several tools and functions that retrieve real-time information related to the stock of interest. Key data sources include:
- Company's financial statements;
- Historic stock price data (e.g., 1 month or 1 year, depending on the model's context length);
- Latest company-related news.

These factors provide a comprehensive view of the company's historical performance and current market sentiment. Additional tools can be added as needed.

### TODO:

Calculate the fair market value of a company using one of the following or all of the methods:

# Non-market value 
1. **Book Value**:
   - **Explanation**: Book value is the value of a company's assets minus its liabilities as reported on the balance sheet. It represents the net worth of a company based on historical costs.
   - **Formula**: Book Value = Total Assets - Total Liabilities

2. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**:
   - **Explanation**: DCF estimates the present value of a company based on its expected future cash flows. It considers the time value of money, risk, and growth potential.
   - **Formula**: DCF = CF1 / (1+r)^1 + CF2 / (1+r)^2 + ... + CFn / (1+r)^n

3. **Earnings Multiplier**:
   - **Explanation**: The earnings multiplier, or P/E ratio, compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share, indicating how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.
   - **Formula**: Earnings Multiplier = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share

4. **Present Value of a Growing Perpetuity Formula**:
   - **Explanation**: This formula calculates the present value of an infinite series of cash flows growing at a constant rate, providing an estimate of the total value.
   - **Formula**: PV = C / (r-g)

# Market Value 
1. **Market Capitalization**:
   - **Explanation**: Market cap is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares. It reflects what the market values the company at.
   - **Formula**: Market Cap = Share Price x Total Shares Outstanding

2. **Enterprise Value**:
   - **Explanation**: Enterprise value is a comprehensive measure of a company's total value, including debt and equity. It provides a more accurate picture of a company's worth.
   - **Formula**: Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents

**IMPORTANT**: If the company's book value and DCF value is less than its market capitalization (price per stock x # of stocks) - the company is undervalued. If company's stock dropped due to bad news or sudden problems - calculate the probability of the company to be able to fix the problem and buy based on this risk if the return is positive.
