### StockBot ðŸ“ˆ

A LangChain and LLM-based AI system designed to assist with stock investment by utilizing real-time and historical financial data. As a retail investor without a finance background, understanding complex financial terms can be challenging and time-consuming. To address this issue, we have developed an AI bot that leverages LLM technology to provide investment analysis.

### Data sources

The bot incorporates several tools and functions that retrieve real-time information related to the stock of interest. Key data sources include:
- Company's financial statements;
- Historic stock price data (e.g., 1 month or 1 year, depending on the model's context length);
- Latest company-related news.

These factors provide a comprehensive view of the company's historical performance and current market sentiment. Additional tools can be added as needed.

### LangChain ReAct agent

The response and action agent were initially used for stock analysis, but the results were inconsistent. This approach involves a dynamic thought process during runtime, with actions based on the agent's thoughts. However, it may get stuck in an infinite loop of thoughts and actions, making it unsuitable for complex tasks such as stock analysis. Further improvements can be made by modifying the prompt.
